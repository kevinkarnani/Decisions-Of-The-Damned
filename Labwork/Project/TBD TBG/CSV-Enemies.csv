1,"Marquise (Round 1)",20,15,200,40,40,20,"Standing before you in shining gold and purple armor is Marquise, the right hand man to the king. A wide, shit-eating grin spreads across his face. He will take great pleasure in harming you.","With one swift motion, you strike Marquise in the back of the head with the blunt of your sword."
2,"a Bulette",55,2,150,60,30,10,"Before you is a bulette, with a hide like bone, claws the size of your arm, and an impossibly large jaw filled with rows and rows of razor sharp teeth.","With a roar that seems to shake the very ground, the bulette attempts a final attack. It does not reach you, as it succumbs to its wounds and crashes to the floor. This predator will not be hunting again."
3,"a Anhkeg",65,30,120,40,20,40,"Standing over 12 feet tall in front of you is what appears to be a monstrous ant, acid dripping from its massive mandibles.","With your final blow, you jam your blade into its mouth, right between the mandibles. You push further and further in until it goes limp and crumples to the ground."
4,"a Royal Guard",30,15,80,50,30,20,"A royal guard stands in front of you, the royal emblem is emblazoned on his shield. He is intent on keeping you away from the king.","With one swift motion you cleave his head clean from his body. While this man may have been innocent, because he was corrupted by the king, he was dangerous."
5,"Marquise (Round 2)",60,30,80,20,40,40,"Once again you face Marquise, this time he appears to be more wary of you. Instead of a shit-eating grin, there is a look of determination on his face.","With a crack you strike him at the back of his head with blunt of the sword. He now kneels in front of you, a look of shock on his face."
6,"King Gott",85,20,250,35,30,35,"King Gott stands above you, a sneer curling across his face. He plans to end this quickly and mercilessly. Little does he know, you’re stronger than you look.","You plunge through Gott’s heart, a shocked grunt escaping his mouth. As the light leaves his eyes, they seem to bore into your soul with an all consuming rage."
