Before he can pierce your throat, however, a loud voice calls out: “Marquise, spare him now if you wish to keep your life.” The source of this voice is an imposing figure of broad shoulders and golden hair. In his hands he holds a massive platinum sword, he could cleave a man in two if he wished.
You don’t recognize him, but it seems that Marquise definitely does, as suddenly the sword is no longer at your throat. You turn and see Marquise booking it away from your apparent savior. Your new knight buddy offers you a hand.

E2F,"“Allow me to explain. Marquise is the right hand of this land’s king, King Gott. Our kingdoms were able to coexist peacefully up until recently. My country’s emissaries began reporting that King Gott was making moves to consolidate his power even further and planned to annex Amestria. Then out of the blue, our emissaries all sent letters stating that they were defecting from Amestria as they believes that King Gott should rule over all. As alarming as this was, it was even more concerning when we realized that all of these letters were written in the same handwriting. My king then dispatched me and a small team of other knights to infiltrate the kingdom and stop his plan. I was the only one to make it this far, as Marquise and his men were able to take out my comrades. The reason he fears me is that I was able to beat him into submission despite my back being against the wall.” Al shares.
“Knowing what King Gott plans to do, I know I must defeat him, but I cannot do it alone. I was hoping I could count on you as you have been wrapped up in this too. The journey to his lair might be dangerous, but I believe that it is necessary. If not, then all of Amestria, no, the entire continent might be in danger of coming under his dominion!” His voice softens.
