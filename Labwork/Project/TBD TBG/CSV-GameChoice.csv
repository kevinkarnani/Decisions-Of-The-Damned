D2A,"You fall to your knees, your sword clattering to the ground beside you. You feel the tip of Marquise's sword pressed against your throat. You look up and meet his gaze with equal intensity. He begins to push his sword into your neck, saying, ""For your crimes against King Gott, you will pay with your life!""
Before he can pierce your throat, however, a loud voice calls out: ""Marquise, spare him now if you wish to keep your life."" The source of this voice is an imposing figure of broad shoulders and golden hair. In his hands he holds a massive platinum sword, he could cleave a man in two if he wished.
You don't recognize him, but it seems that Marquise definitely does, as suddenly the sword is no longer at your throat. You turn and see Marquise booking it away from your apparent savior. Your new knight buddy offers you a hand.

From there you explain everything that has happened the past two days and how you can't remember anything prior to waking up in that crash site, including your name. The knight takes some time to ponder what you've said and after a long pause eventually speaks.

As alarming as this was, it was even more concerning when we realized that all of these letters were written in the same handwriting. My king then dispatched me and a small team of other knights to infiltrate the kingdom and stop his plan. I was the only one to make it this far, as Marquise and his men were able to take out my comrades.

""Knowing what King Gott plans to do, I know I must defeat him, but I cannot do it alone. I was hoping I could count on you as you have been wrapped up in this too.

And so, you and Al began your journey, venturing towards the edge of the village. Many adventures surely await!","Onward to adventure!","G1A","0"
F1D,"Al catches up with you, a disappointed and sad expression on his face. It lingers for a moment, disappearing as he matches your pace.

G1A,"Once you and Al have set off on your way, you see a large mountain range standing tall in the distance. Al tells you that King Gott has made his home there due to its strategic positioning. He is able to control much of the land from that position safe and sound due to its sheer cliffs. You can think of only one way you could reach the castle.
""Is there a way we can travel through the mountain?""
""That is correct!"" Al responds. ""This passage I am leading us to does not go from one side of the mountain to the other, but rather from the bottom to the top. The entire path is within the mountain itself""","""So… we’re just going waltz our way in there?"",""Am I correct in assuming that the pathway will be somewhat fortified?""","G1B,G1C","0,0"

G1E,"""Yep, most of the soldiers stay inside the castle since there seems to be no end to the monsters. They tend to burrow out of the walls and ambush those walking the passage.

They must have a secret exit somewhere.""","""We will do what we have to.""","G1F","0"
G1F,"""That’s the spirit! You’re shaping up to be a true hero!"""
(You both are going to die.)
Al abruptly stops walking and stares for a moment. You follow his gaze and find that you two have already reached the passage, having been caught up in conversation. It is quite large, so it is almost impressive that you didn’t notice it. You probably would have walked straight into the mountain had Al not noticed. It appears the mouth of the tunnel is what caught Al’s attention. Large, jagged rocks protrude out from the entrance, almost like jaws.
""Welp! Looks like it’s now or never!""","Follow Al","H1A","0"
H1A,"As soon as you and Al enter the mountain, you notice a pathway leading upwards through a tunnel.

Your conversation is interrupted as two Bulettes burst out of the wall. Their deep growls seem to reverberate in your chest.
Al pulls his greatsword from his back and steels himself. “I’ll take the right one, you handle the left."
